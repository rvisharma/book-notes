- Eliminate distractions
- Format content to support scanning


### Conventions

>  Conventions help user to grasp anything quickly, without much coginitive load.

-	How conventions are built up?
    - They come from someone's idea
    - If the idea works, people imitate it
    - And it eventually people see it in so many places that they don't need any explanation any more.  
-   If conventions are great then why do we feel reluctant to go with existing convention?
    - convention works but we might feel to innovate our new design, and move away from same old design for every website.
    - re-inventing the wheel
    - re-inventing is okay, as long as there is significant value in return.
- If you're not choosing existing convention, then should keep in mind 2 important things.
    - It should be very clear and self-explanatory such that there's no learning curve.
    - It should add so much value that is worth of learning curve.
    
> Consistency vs Clarity â€“ CLARITY TRUMPS CONSISTENCY

Consistency is a good thing to strive for, but there will be cases where things be _clearer_ if they are slightly inconsistent.
Choose clarity in favor of consistency.


### Create effective visual hierarchies

Clear visual heirarchy have 3 traits:
- More important bits are more prominent
    - They a either larger/bolder/distinctive color
    - have more white space, nearer to top of the page
- Logically related things are related visually as well.
- Things are nested visually to create a distinction to group similar parts.

Having the visual heirarchy helps user to grasp the content in an efficient manner.
In case of missing visual heirarchy, the scanning time increases which leads to confusion and frustration.


### Breaking pages into clearly defined areas

Users should be able to quickly identify which parts of the page does what. 
It allows users to focus on area which is more important to their current task and which parts of the page that can be safely ignored.

### Make it obvious what's clickable

Users are always scanning for visual cues on the page to _click_ somewhere to get their task done. Make that obvious. It's important to make it easy to tell what's clickable.
Keep the clickable things are consistent and distinctive from the non clickable things like headings.


### Keep the noise down

Complexity and distractions are downright annoying. There are three kinds of noise:
- **Shouting.** When everything in page screaming for attention, the effect is overwhelming.
    > __everything__ cannot be important. It is a failure to make decision and identify the important parts of page.
- **Disorganization.** When pages are not visually aligned. looks like a mess.
- **Clutter.** Strive for high signal to noise ratio.
    - Remove the parts that are not making any real contribution.
    - When there's a lot of stuff in the page, it is hard to focus on the important part.


### Format text to support scanning

> The way text is formatted can do a lot to make it easier for them.

- **Use plenty of headings.** Helps to decide which part to read, scan or skip.
    - Format the headings clearly and keep ample whitespace
    - Do not float the headings in between sections, they should be close to the section they're part of.
- **Keep the para's short.** Web reading is not printed text. Keep the paras short and once sentence paragraphs are also fine.
- **Use bulleted lists.** Things that are separated with comma, semicolons could be translated to bulleted lists. They lead to optimal readability.
- **Highlight key terms.** bold the important parts of the text on their first occurence to make them easier to find. But don't overdo it.
