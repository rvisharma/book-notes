#### Conventions
>  Conventions help user to grasp anything quickly, without much coginitive load.

-	How conventions are built up?
    - They come from someone's idea
    - If the idea works, people imitate it
    - And it eventually people see it in so many places that they don't need any explanation any more.  
-   If conventions are great then why do we feel reluctant to go with existing convention?
    - convention works but we might feel to innovate our new design, and move away from same old design for every website.
    - re-inventing the wheel
    - re-inventing is okay, as long as there is significant value in return.
- If you're not choosing existing convention, then should keep in mind 2 important things.
    - It should be very clear and self-explanatory such that there's no learning curve.
    - It should add so much value that is worth of learning curve.
